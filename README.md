# Can you beat Park? - Educational Teaching Simulation Game

An interactive React-based educational game where players act as instructors trying to maximize student learning through strategic teaching task management. Players complete three types of tasks across multiple semesters with time pressure and AI assistance.

## üéØ Game Overview

**Objective**: Maximize student learning points by strategically completing teaching tasks across multiple semesters.

### üéÆ Strategic Mechanics (ORDER MATTERS!)

**Key Insight**: Task completion order significantly affects your final score!

**Core Mechanics**:
- **Materials Tasks** (Slider precision) ‚Üí Direct base points
- **Research Tasks** (Pattern counting) ‚Üí 15% multiplier per point to FUTURE materials only
- **Engagement Tasks** (Text replication) ‚Üí 0.15% compound interest per point after each task

**Scoring Formula**: `Score = Materials √ó (1 + Research√ó0.15) + Engagement Interest`
- Research multipliers ONLY apply to materials earned AFTER the research
- Players must discover the optimal strategy through experimentation or AI assistance!

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Run ESLint
npm run lint

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Game Flow
1. **Student Login** ‚Üí Access code validation
2. **Practice Mode** ‚Üí Mandatory practice requiring 100% accuracy
3. **Main Game** ‚Üí Timed teaching simulation (20min students, 2min admin)
4. **Completion** ‚Üí Unique completion code generation

### Key Components
- **App.jsx** (2835+ lines) - Main game orchestrator
- **Task Components**: SliderTask, CountingTask, TypingTask
- **AI Assistant** (ChatContainer.jsx) - Deterministic help with 75% accuracy
- **Session Management** - Firebase integration with offline fallback

### AI Help System
**Deterministic Pattern (First 5 uses)**:
1. Correct (2 pts)
2. Correct (2 pts) 
3. Off by 1 (1 pt)
4. Correct (2 pts)
5. Correct (2 pts)
6+ 75% correct, 25% mistakes (over-highlighting for visibility)

## üìä Data Collection

**Comprehensive Analytics**:
- Readable timestamps (MM:SS after semester start)
- Complete task attempt history with accuracy progression
- AI interaction tracking (help requests, player responses, time between help and submission)
- Click tracking with element details and coordinates
- Chat interaction analysis with query categorization
- Learning curve analysis and performance metrics

**Firebase Collections**:
- **Events**: All user interactions with detailed context
- **Sessions**: Persistent session data with real-time updates
